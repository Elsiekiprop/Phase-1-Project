# Phase-1-Project
## Introduction
A number of companies have been creating original content. Therefore, Microsoft wants to do the same. However, they do not have Knowledge on how to go about film creation. The task given is to find suitable recommendations on the types of films that Microsoft can create. Having been presented various datasets, the requirement is to pick the datasets required to perform data analysis that will provide optimal insights.
## Data Analysis
I chose to use ```'bom.movie_gross.xlsx''``` data set which contains data on movie titles, the release years, the domestic and foreign gross as well as the studios that produced each of these movies. This data set is important in finding which movies and studios performed well financially.
The second dataset used was the ```'tmdb.movies.xlsx'``` dataset which has data on movie titles, the popularity index, the vote counts, the language used and the vote averages.
Data analysis was done using python. 
Data cleaning was done before doing exploratory data analysis on both of the datasets to remove the null values and drop unnecessary data to keep the meaningful and relevant data.
Visualizations such us bar graphs, horizontal bar graphs, pie charts and scatter plots were used in the analysis of the data to find useful insights.
The codes have been presented in the jupyter notebooks and a none technical presentation has been done.
